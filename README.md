Overview
Designed and implemented a Parking Lot Management System using Java, following Object-Oriented Design (OOPs) principles and Low-Level Design (LLD). The system supports multi-floor parking, vehicle-specific slots, ticket generation and spot allocation at entry, and dynamic pricing strategies at exit. Implemented Strategy Pattern for flexible payment algorithms, supported cash and online payments with third-party payment gateway integration, and designed separate entry/exit gates with optimized parking allocation strategies to enhance user experience.
